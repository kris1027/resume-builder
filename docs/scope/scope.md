# Scope: Resume Builder

A free, no sign up resume builder for job seekers (EN/PL): fill a form, pick one of three print clean templates, export or import a PDF. This pass checks the stack, refactors toward modern practice, makes the app faster, and refreshes the app UI. The resume templates keep their current look.

**Build approach:** Tracer Bullet (each change lands end to end and working, so the app stays shippable after every step).
**Workflow:** Prototype (just `/develop`, nothing after it; you rely on its build time self check plus the existing vitest and pre commit checks). `/architect` is the recommended first stop for a feature with a real decision, but skippable when you already know the build. Any feature can carry its own tag (e.g. `· Beta`) to do more or less.

_These are recommendations to keep your build orderly, not requirements. Skip anything that does not fit: if you already know how to build a feature, use `/develop` and skip `/architect`. You decide when a feature is `done`._

**Constraints for this pass:** breaking the saved localStorage shape is allowed (no migration owed). Refreshed UI targets WCAG 2.2 AA and Lighthouse 95+ in every category. Templates stay white and print optimized; a new section still lands in all three.

## Foundations

### 1. Coding standards & AGENTS.md

Capture the real conventions (CLAUDE.md rules, folder layout, testing, i18n, template rules) in a root `AGENTS.md` so every later step reads the same context.
**Done when:** root `AGENTS.md` describes the current stack and conventions, and `CLAUDE.md` points to it.

- [x] Capture conventions: `/audit`

### 2. Stack review · in-progress

Check every layer (build, router, forms, validation, UI primitives, animation, PDF render, PDF parse, dates, lint/format, tests, PWA) against current best practice and decide keep, upgrade, or replace for each.
**Done when:** a spec records a verdict and reason per layer, and every replacement is enrolled here as its own row.
spec [0001](../specs/0001-stack-review/index.md)

- [x] Design it (spec): `/architect stack review`

### 3. Upgrades & replacements · done

Apply the verdicts from the stack review one layer at a time, so tests and build stay green after each.
**Done when:** every "upgrade" verdict is applied, lint, tests, typecheck and build pass, and the app runs with no console errors.
spec [0001](../specs/0001-stack-review/index.md) (build plan steps 1 to 7 and 12)
code in `package.json`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `vite.config.ts`, `eslint.config.js`, `src/components/icons/`

- [x] Build it: `/develop upgrades & replacements`
    - [x] Runtime, pnpm 12 and dead code removal (step 1), AC-1, AC-9
    - [x] Toolchain: minors, TS 6, Vite 8, Vitest 5, ESLint 10 (steps 2 to 6), AC-1, AC-2, AC-4

### 17. Unified radix-ui package · done · from spec 0001

Swap the seven `@radix-ui/react-*` packages for the single `radix-ui` package; same components, only import paths change.
**Done when:** no `@radix-ui/react-*` entry is left in `package.json` and every dialog, select, popover and menu works as before.
spec [0001](../specs/0001-stack-review/index.md) (build plan step 8). code in `src/components/ui/`

- [x] Build it: `/develop unified radix-ui package`

### 18. Intl dates instead of date-fns · done · from spec 0001

Format month and year with the browser's `Intl.DateTimeFormat` in the app and all three PDF templates, then drop `date-fns`.
**Done when:** a pinning test shows identical EN and PL output for all 12 months, and `date-fns` is gone.
spec [0001](../specs/0001-stack-review/index.md) (build plan step 9). code in `src/lib/date-utils.ts`, `src/lib/pdf-templates/`

- [x] Build it: `/develop intl dates`

### 19. Single CSP source · done · from spec 0001

`vite.config.ts` reads the CSP from `vercel.json` instead of keeping its own copy.
**Done when:** the CSP string appears once in the repo, and the meta tag and deployed header match on a preview deployment.
spec [0001](../specs/0001-stack-review/index.md) (build plan step 10). code in `vite.config.ts`, `tsconfig.node.json`

- [x] Build it: `/develop single csp source`

### 20. React Compiler · from spec 0001

Turn on the React Compiler in the build and the tests, with the React hooks v7 lint rules.
**Done when:** the compiler runs in build and tests, lint reports compiler rules, and the builder behaves as before.
spec [0001](../specs/0001-stack-review/index.md) (build plan step 11)

- [ ] Build it: `/develop react compiler`

### 4. Feature based folder structure · needs a decision

Move from type based folders (`components`, `lib`, `pages`) to feature areas (landing, templates, builder, preview, pdf) so later refactors land in clear homes.
**Done when:** each feature area owns its components, hooks and logic, shared code lives in one place, and imports follow one rule.

- [ ] Design it (spec): `/architect folder structure`

### 5. Performance budgets · needs a decision

Measure today's bundle, Lighthouse scores and builder render cost, then set budgets the build enforces so later work cannot quietly regress.
**Done when:** a baseline is recorded in the spec, and the build or CI fails when a page's JS budget or Lighthouse threshold is broken.

- [ ] Design it (spec): `/architect performance budgets`

### 6. Design system refresh · needs a decision

New visual language for the app shell (type, color, spacing, motion, components) in light and dark, meeting WCAG 2.2 AA. Templates are out of scope.
**Done when:** tokens and base components are defined and documented, contrast and focus states pass AA in both themes, and motion respects reduced motion.

- [ ] Design it (spec): `/architect design system refresh`

## Slice 1: Refactor the core

### 7. Builder page split · needs a decision

Break the 788 line builder page into focused pieces with clear form state boundaries (form, section list, toolbar, import/save dialogs).
**Done when:** no builder file is over roughly 250 lines, each section owns its own state slice, and builder behavior is unchanged under the existing tests.

- [ ] Design it (spec): `/architect builder page split`

### 8. Shared template model · needs a decision

One description of each template's sections that drives both the web preview and the PDF version, so a new section is added in one place instead of six.
**Done when:** web and PDF output for all three templates come from the shared model, and both still match today's look.

- [ ] Design it (spec): `/architect shared template model`

### 9. PDF import parser restructure · needs a decision

Split the 872 line parser into small, testable steps (extract text, detect template, map sections) so it is easier to extend when templates change.
**Done when:** each step is its own module with tests, and PDFs exported by all three templates still import correctly.

- [ ] Design it (spec): `/architect pdf import parser`

## Slice 2: Make it fast

### 10. Lazy load heavy engines

Load the PDF renderer, pdf.js, fonts and the animation library only on the pages and actions that need them, within the budgets from feature 5.
**Done when:** the landing page ships none of those engines, export and import still work offline, and every page meets its JS budget.

- [ ] Build it: `/develop lazy load heavy engines`

### 11. Builder responsiveness · needs a decision

Keep typing and the live preview smooth on long resumes: fewer rerenders, cheaper autosave, preview that never blocks input.
**Done when:** typing in any field on a long sample resume shows no dropped frames in a profile, and autosave never runs on every keystroke.

- [ ] Design it (spec): `/architect builder responsiveness`

## Slice 3: Refresh the UI

### 12. Landing page refresh · needs a decision

Rebuild the home page on the new design system, keeping parallax on decorative layers only.
**Done when:** the page uses the new tokens and components, reads well at phone width, and keeps its SEO metadata.

- [ ] Design it (spec): `/architect landing page refresh`

### 13. Template gallery refresh · needs a decision

Gallery and template detail pages on the new design system, with previews that load fast.
**Done when:** both pages use the new components, previews render without layout shift, and choosing a template still sets `?templateId=`.

- [ ] Design it (spec): `/architect template gallery refresh`

### 14. Builder UI refresh · needs a decision

The form, section cards, drag handles and dialogs on the new design system, built on the split from feature 7.
**Done when:** every section and dialog uses the new components, errors still show only after touch, and the builder works fully by keyboard.

- [ ] Design it (spec): `/architect builder ui refresh`

### 15. Preview & export UI refresh · needs a decision

Preview page chrome (mode switch, export, back to edit) on the new design system; the resume itself stays white and print clean.
**Done when:** the toolbar uses the new components in both themes, the resume area is unchanged, and print output is unchanged.

- [ ] Design it (spec): `/architect preview ui refresh`

### 16. Accessibility & Lighthouse pass

A final sweep across every page against WCAG 2.2 AA and the Lighthouse targets, fixing what the refresh missed.
**Done when:** every page scores 95+ in all four Lighthouse categories and an automated axe check finds no serious issues, in EN and PL, light and dark.

- [ ] Build it: `/develop accessibility & lighthouse pass`

## Deferred

Out of scope for this pass, kept so the plan stays honest.

- **Template visual refresh**: new look for the three resume templates (web and PDF) · needs a decision
- **More templates**: a fourth template once the shared model (feature 8) makes it cheap · needs a decision

## Legend

**The decision box.** Every designed feature carries exactly one sub task whose label ends with `(spec)`. Skills find it by that suffix, never by an exact label. Every other box is an execution box and `/architect` never ticks one.

**Feature lifecycle**:

| State                        | Set by                           | The feature shows                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `planned` · needs a decision | `/scope`                         | one box: `Design it (spec): /architect <feature>`                                                  |
| `in-progress` (designed)     | **`/architect` at spec capture** | `Design it` ticked; spec linked; `Build it: /develop <feature>` + **2 to 5 milestones**            |
| `in-progress` (building)     | `/develop`                       | milestone sub boxes tick one by one; code pointer filled                                           |
| `done`                       | **you, when you decide it is**   | boxes you ran ticked; at `Prototype` the suggested point to call it done is right after `/develop` |

- **Next step** = the first unticked box (always a command or a tracked milestone).
- **needs a decision** = run `/architect` first; otherwise straight to `/develop` (or `/audit` for standards & tooling). The tag drops once the spec is captured.
- **Atomic build tasks live in the spec's `## Build plan`, not here**: the scope carries only the milestone rollup.
- **Status** `planned` → `in-progress` → `done`, plus `existing` (pre workflow) and `dropped` (de scoped, kept for history).
- **Approach tag** beside a heading (e.g. `· Facade`) overrides the project default for that feature; no tag inherits it.
- **Workflow tier tag** beside a heading (e.g. `· Beta`) sets that one feature's rigor; no tag inherits the default.
- **Workflow** (header line), what runs after `/develop`: **Prototype** = nothing; **Alpha** = `/check verify`; **Beta** = `/check verify` then `/test`; **GA** = adds a fresh model `/check review` then `/document`. A feature built on an unratified decision (an `Assumed` spec) stays flagged, but that never blocks `done`.
- **Pointer line** (`spec <n> · code in <path>`): the spec link added by `/architect`, the code path by `/develop`.
